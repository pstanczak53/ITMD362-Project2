# ITMD362-Project2

Self-critique
I am still a beginner, but with each project I am improving my ability to code in html/CSS. I think this course opened my mind to the visual presentation of the pages and emotional impact and importance of the overall design. Before I took this course I often struggled when using IIT website. Especially when registering for the courses. After this course, I am confident that I have a clear understanding how properly designed website should work, and how I would improve IIT registration process on the web.

Critique of each group member’s 
Nick: Nick was really helpful and from the beginning took strong charge in coding in html. Fast coder, and good problem-solving skills. He is also good listener and responsive to other’s input.
Andrzej: Andy took role of a Project Manager, reminding me and others what has to be done, kept project on track and also working on the overall design, updates on GitHub. He is friendly and easy to work with.
Melissa: Melissa paid attention to detail and helped us with visual impact of the design and coding. She is fast and a good organizer, she helped us to organize meetups.
Me: I was working on the login structure of the login page. Created java script for the login, and CSS to style. I was also helping to create fist page desktop image and some other small changes to CSS style. I think we all worked well as a group.
